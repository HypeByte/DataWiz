State: Work in progress.

Updates:
-Fixed Buffer Overflow vulnerability at Baseplate-Algortihms/ConversionsLib.c
-Debugged some functions
-Added compiler support at Baseplate-Algorithms/ConversionsLib.c
-Added a huge bug patch to my Getters.c module. You will now be able to get strings, chars, integers, and decimals. More Getter functions coming soon :)
-Added new get long int method to get long ints from .dtwiz scripts. Long ints are integers but they allow you to store more large numbers.
