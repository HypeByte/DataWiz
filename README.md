# DataWiz

DataWiz is still in development, and will be released soon. DataWiz is an API/data format for storing data on the local host. DataWiz can also be paired with roblox exploits like Synapse X, you will have to use lua C to use the API. If you use DataWiz with Synapse X, your scripts will be able to store data about the user who is using them, and about the game enviroment.
