# DataWiz

DataWiz is still in development, and will be released soon. DataWiz is an API/data format for storing data on the local host. DataWiz can also be paired with roblox exploits like Synapse X, you will have to use lua C to use the API. If you use DataWiz with Synapse X, your scripts will be able to store data about the user who is using them, and about the game enviroment. DataWiz is best for storing data on the local host. You can make advanced scripts that remember the user. You can do stuff like make a shop in your scripts, and the currency is how much time the user has been on the script. DataWiz will be a revolution to roblox exploiting. Written C for most support, might use C++ for some more advanced stuff.
